This is the official organization page for projects of the [Computational Science Studies Lab (CSS Lab)](https://www.css-lab.rwth-aachen.de/).<br />
Amongst others, you can find information about the chair, our research interests and the source code for our publications. For more information about our Tools visit their respective Repository.

## Research
How does algorithmic thinking change science and technology? How do scientific concepts transform? The CSS Lab is dedicated to the understanding of the digital transformation of science. We are developing a conceptual framework for a Philosophy of Computational Sciences and Technology.<br />
Our research is dedicated to the understanding of the "radical transformation of the nature of science" through digitalization (EU Horizon 2020). For decades now, computer-based modelling and simulation have expanded the methods of science. Today, computational departments complement their experimental and theoretical counterparts. In recent years, big data analytics and artificial intelligence, in particular machine learning, have propelled the digital transformation of science and technology. Thus, knowledge production in science and technology development have changed tremendously. Understanding these shifts is our concern.<br />
How do scientific concepts and practices change? How are computational sciences informed by new forms of knowledge production such as computer-based simulation and machine-learning methods? How reliable are the results of computational sciences?<br />
The CSS Lab is building an infrastructure for conducting Computational Science Studies (CSS). It explores traditional Science and Technology Studies methods such as interviews, participatory observation, and text analysis for case studies. A further focus is on the investigation of new methods such as code and programming studies. In the process, software tools are developed in order to support Computational Science Studies.

## Tools
How can we explore computational sciences? How can we ease the study of computational sciences? The CSS Lab is building an open science infrastructure for Computational Science Studies. We are programming software tools designed to facilitate case studies on computational sciences in the subfield of code studies. Therefore, our Tools fulfil three demands:<br /><br />
- The CSS Tools visualize software structures in order to better analyse them;
- The CSS Tools help to conduct code genealogies as well as code comparisons;
- The CSS Tools help to analyse the scientific content of software projects.

| Repository | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| GICAT | The GICAT Tool visualizes code structures of any given code project. It shows the genealogy based a git Repository and uses Regex to match code patterns which are then being rendered in a graph structure. |
| ICE | The ICE visualizes comments for the most common programming languages such as Python, C/C++, Fortran, etc. It extracts the comments of a software project and links the comments to the code. |
