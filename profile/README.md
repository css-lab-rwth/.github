## Research
How does algorithmic thinking change science and technology? How do scientific concepts transform? The CSS Lab is dedicated to the understanding of the digital transformation of science. We are developing a conceptual framework for a Philosophy of Computational Sciences and Technology.<br />
Our research is dedicated to the understanding of the "radical transformation of the nature of science" through digitalization (EU Horizon 2020). For decades now, computer-based modelling and simulation have expanded the methods of science. Today, computational departments complement their experimental and theoretical counterparts. In recent years, big data analytics and artificial intelligence, in particular machine learning, have propelled the digital transformation of science and technology. Thus, knowledge production in science and technology development have changed tremendously. Understanding these shifts is our concern.<br />
The Computational Science Studies (CSS) Lab explores the ongoing shift from science to computational sciences. Rooted in philosophy of science and technology, the CSS Lab focuses on understanding the transformative power of digitalization for science and technology. How do scientific concepts and practices change? How are computational sciences informed by new forms of knowledge production such as computer-based simulation and machine-learning methods? How reliable are the results of computational sciences?<br />
Many more questions can be posed, but what is required are methods for exploring new research methods to preserve access to the sciences as they vanish into the computer and algorithms. The CSS Lab is building an infrastructure for conducting Computational Science Studies (CSS). It explores traditional Science and Technology Studies methods such as interviews, participatory observation, and text analysis for case studies. A further focus is on the investigation of new methods such as code and programming studies. In the process, software tools are developed in order to support Computational Science Studies.

## Tools
How can we explore computational sciences? How can we ease the study of computational sciences? The CSS Lab is building an open science infrastructure for Computational Science Studies. We are programming software tools designed to facilitate case studies on computational sciences in the subfield of code studies.
